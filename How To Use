Financial Chatbot Prototype
Developer: Mutammim Alom
Project: Financial Chatbot for SEC Data Analysis

Description:
This chatbot provides financial insights based on SEC filings, including revenue, net income, and company growth. It can be accessed via a Flask web API or through automated test queries.

📌 Files in This Project

app.py	The Flask web application that runs the chatbot API.
test_chatbot.py	A Python script that runs test queries and saves results.
SEC.csv	The cleaned financial dataset used for analysis.
chatbot_test_results.csv	The CSV file containing chatbot responses to predefined queries.
chatbot_test_results.txt	A readable text version of chatbot test results.
README.txt	This documentation explaining the project.


🚀 How to Run the Chatbot
1️⃣ Run the Flask API (for real-time chatbot use)

Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder:
cd path/to/your/project

Run the Flask application:
python app.py

Open your browser and test the chatbot with a query:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/chatbot?query=What%20is%20the%20total%20revenue?
Example API response:
{
  "response": "The total revenue across all companies is 891,000.00 million USD."
}

2️⃣ Run Automated Tests
To generate chatbot responses for predefined queries:
python test_chatbot.py

This creates chatbot_test_results.csv and chatbot_test_results.txt.
🔍 Features
✅ Responds to financial queries such as revenue, net income, and growth.
✅ Uses real financial data from SEC reports.
✅ Supports both API interaction & automated testing.
✅ Saves test results for analysis.

⚠️ Limitations
🚨 Only supports predefined queries (cannot answer free-text questions).
🚨 Data is static (not updated automatically).
🚨 Requires structured queries (e.g., "What is the total revenue?").
